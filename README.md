<i><b>WARNING: The project is not finalized (2022-2023), without support (simple MIT), created only to confirm the theory.</b></i>

<i><b>WARNING: The application was written back when esp32 did not have official support for bluetooth beacons on rust, so the code contained only links with C code.</b></i>


## Description

This repository contains a prototype system for covert data transmission via Bluetooth, mimicking beacons. The system is developed for educational purposes and is intended for experimentation.

## Key Features

• ESP32 (Rust): The ESP32 microcontroller, programmed in Rust, emulates a standard Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacon and sends hidden data.

• Android (DemoApp, Cordova, JS): A demo Android application, developed using Cordova and JavaScript, demonstrates the sending and receiving of hidden data.

## Repository Structure

• esp32 (Rust)

• demo_android_bluetest (Android, JS, Cordova)
